# Tables and forms

Following up on the favourite sites page from the previous week, we will now create a page listing our favourite site using a table. Moreover we will create a form to allow users to subscribe to our site so we can send them an automatic email every time the site is updated with a new entry.
Note that here we are just building the form but not the part sending automatic emails :)
If you did the tables module and the first lesson of the form module in Codecademy you should be able to do this challenge.

Notice the following things:
- There is a submission page to redirect users once they click the Subscribe button.  
- The submission page let's you come back to the main site if you click the header "My Favourite Sites". How can we navigate through pages?
- The CSS file and content is linked with the HTML file and elements:
  - How the css file is linked with the html file?
  - How do you set color for the background of different elements and the text?

Play around, tinker and see how things change.
