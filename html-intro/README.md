# Intro to HTML

Create “Your favourites site”. This is a toy project for you to practice what you have learnt :rocket: If you finished  the 2 introductory modules in Codecademy you now know how to add different types of media content in an HTML page (text, image, video) and create links to external pages as well as linking to other parts of your document.

The idea is to do something similar but to use sections that are personal to you (maybe it is cooking, fashion, design, sports, whatever you are interested in) and add links to articles, blogs, websites and so on.

Notice the different aspects present in this site:
- Links to external pages
- Links to internal content
- Video (how do you embed a video from Youtube??)
- Images from the Internet
- Use of text style (bold and italic)
- Contact information
